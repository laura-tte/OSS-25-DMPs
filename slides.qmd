## Code of conduct

To make the most of our time together, we ask everyone to follow these simple guidelines:

- **Engage actively**: This is not a lecture but an interactive session. Share your thoughts, ideas, and experiences.
- **Collaborate**: Discuss in pairs or groups. The goal is to learn together. Helping each other is strongly encouraged!
- **Discuss the content**: Your insights will help everyone learn.
- **Ask questions**: If something is unclear, chances are others are wondering the same.

## Topics

- What is a Data Management Plan?
- Why is it helpful?
- Content of a Data Management Plan 
- Data Management Plan tools: RDMO 

::: {.callout-tip}
## Tasks
üõ†Ô∏è  The session is mixed with small exercises and leaves time for you to work on your own Data Management Plan.

## General information

This content is based on the OSC tutorial for FAIR Research Data Management: [https://lmu-osc.github.io/FAIR-Data-Management/](https://lmu-osc.github.io/FAIR-Data-Management/)

## What is a Data Management plan?

- Document that outlines how data will be handled during and after a research project
- Structures¬†data management¬†in a way that it is¬†easier to¬†keep track of it

## Why is a DMP helpful?

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}
::: {.incremental}
- Clarifies central aspects of RDM ‚Üí Structure for and optimization of data management
- Support for your own good scientific work ‚Üí Ensures that your data is complete, accurate and trustworthy
- Guidelines for the entire course of the project ‚Üí "living document‚Äú

## Exercise 1

::: {.callout-tip}
## Task (~10 minutes)
Imagine you are about to start a new research project and your want to create a data management plan. In small groups, list everything you think should be in this plan ‚Äî from the moment you collect the first data to the point years later when someone else might want to reuse it.

Think about:

- the kinds of data you‚Äôll produce
- how and where you‚Äôll store them during the project
- how you‚Äôll document your data so others can understand them
- how you‚Äôll protect sensitive information
- how and where you‚Äôll share or archive them later
- who is responsible for what

## Exercise 1

## Data management tools

::: {.incremental}
- Software to create data management plans
- Simplified workflow, allows collaborative work
- Project management tool for handling research data
- No repository: You do not upload and store your data in a DMP tool
::: 

. . .

Example: [RDMO](https://rdmo.ub.lmu.de/)

![](images/RDMO-logo.png)


## RDMO

- Online-Tool to create DMPs (Open Source) 
- DMPs are stored on local servers (by the LMU)

. . .

Features:

- Use existing DMP templates (called questionnaires)
- Collaborative Work: Rights- and role management
- Import and export DMPs
- Snapshots: Capture different versions of your DMP

## Exercise 2

::: {.callout-tip}
## Task (~25 minutes)
Using RDMO, you will start creating your own Data Management Plan ‚Äî either for your actual research project or for a fictional one you invent in your group.

1. Log in to RDMO: [rdmo.ub.lmu.de](https://rdmo.ub.lmu.de/)
2.  Create a new project using the **RDMO catalog** 
3. Work through the RDMO questions, thinking carefully about:
    - What types of data you will collect or generate?
    - How you will organize and name files?
    - Where and how the data will be stored during the project?
    - How you will ensure backups and data security?
